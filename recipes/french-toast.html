        <h3 class="flavor-text">This fluffy French toast recipe is crisp on the outside, but perfectly soft and tender on the inside.</h3>
        <p class="micro">The secret ingredient in this fluffy French toast recipe: all-purpose flour! Flour binds the liquids together, which creates a more traditional “batter” and helps prevent soggy results. This extra ingredient ensures the French toast is crispy on the outside, but soft and fluffy on the inside.</p>
